Redesigning of web page
https://www.figma.com/file/M4ZTYfUoDZyVExCEb22VfQ/Amazon?node-id=0%3A1
Redesigned the amazon login page 
The orignal was too simple so try to make it ineractive and some what tried to be in dark theme.
Covering all the exact same information as of orignal 
the above designed page has them all and looks good.
Now the user can both login and sign up on a single page.(instead of two different pages)
