# Designing
Designed Some Interface of Library Management System and also recreated Amazon Login Page.

Although Not Complete but yet some interfaces of Library Management System I have made using Figma and therby attached its prototype above.
Also tried to recreate Amazon Login Page.
**Designing of LIbrary Management**

Frankly speaking this involved too many challenges for me (covid at friends home and wedding at my home I was divided)
But still have done as much as possible.

I used iconify plugin for extra icons and then all the designs were self made no template used, Inspiration taken from Amazon Shopping Console and Other user panels are independently thought off. 
Made panel for user, admin, librarian, register, login, display, cart console, profile etc.
Everything is not damm functional but tried to make as much as possible.



Design ready(all buttons text field not working but some do if you play the prototype)

**Redesigning of web page**
https://www.figma.com/file/M4ZTYfUoDZyVExCEb22VfQ/Amazon?node-id=0%3A1

Redesigned the amazon login page 
The orignal was too simple so try to make it ineractive and some what tried to be in dark theme.
Covering all the exact same information as of orignal 
the above designed page has them all and looks good.
Now the user can both login and sign up on a single page.(instead of two different pages)
Inspiration from Facebook's old Signup login console.

Cheers Hope you like it, tried my best.
